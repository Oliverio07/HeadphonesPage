## Objective
_What and why are we doing this?_

A website that shows a headphones brand. I'll code it to improve my web development skills.

## Goals
- Landing page that shows a headphones brand

## Non-Goals
- Page that sells a product

## Overview

Make a website that show a brand of headpohones. It isn't necessary to link a payment gateway, because is not our goal to sell the product on the same website. 

## Detailed Design

 _- What are the new functions that you will write?_

 - The website needs a header, it'll have a sticky effect, when a person clicks on X or Y section, the web will move us there.

 - First section will have the name of the product, a short description and a photo

 - Second section will have a video, it'll show the product.
 
 - Third section will show us a gallery of photos about what are we selling.

 - Fourth section must have a reviews. Minimum of 2 and maximum of 4 reviews.

 - Fifth section will be a contact us form, it'll contain these inputs:
    - Name
    - Subject (This must be a select with option tags about four common issues and "other" option)
    - A text area where people can write their message

 - Now we need a footer, it'll contain links to social media and a newsletter section.

 _- Is there any code that can be reusable?_

 Yes, there are these libraries:

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

- [VideoJS](https://videojs.com)
